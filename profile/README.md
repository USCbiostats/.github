This github organization is used to warehouse and develop software we are working on. You can find that software by clicking on the "Repositories" tab above.
Examples include: 

[cit:](https://github.com/USCbiostats/cit) Causal Inference Testing; </br>
[fdrci:](https://github.com/USCbiostats/fdrci)	Permutation-Based FDR Point and Confidence Interval Estimation; </br>
[LUCIDus:](https://github.com/USCbiostats/LUCIDus)	Latent and Unknown Cluster Analysis using Integrated Data; </br>
[xtune:](https://github.com/USCbiostats/xtune) Lasso and Ridge Regression with differential penalization based on prior knowledge. </br>

In addition, we also use this organization to warehouse other information, such as guidelines for software development and materials from previous seminars, etc. For example, we run a seminar series known as the "Happy Scientist", to ensure that we are happy, not sad. You can find these [here;](https://github.com/USCbiostats/software-dev/tree/master/happy_scientist)
